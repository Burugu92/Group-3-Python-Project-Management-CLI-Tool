📦 Inventory Management CLI Tool

A fully interactive Python Command-Line Inventory Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming principles, modular architecture, authentication, and JSON-based persistent storage.

This project was developed as part of a summative group lab to simulate building a CLI-based startup product.

🚀 Project Overview

Small businesses often need a simple and lightweight way to manage their stock/inventory without expensive software. This project seeks to make that easier and convenient for them.

This CLI tool allows businesses to:

Register and log in securely

Add, update, delete inventory items (Admin only)

View and search items

Track stock levels

Store data persistently using JSON files

The system demonstrates:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Inheritance and encapsulation

Role-based access control

File-based persistence (CRUD operations)

Modular Python structure

Git collaboration workflow

👥 Target Users

Small business owners

Warehouse managers

School or lab inventory supervisors

🧠 System Features
🔐 Authentication System

User registration

User login

Password hashing using hashlib

Role-based access (Admin / Regular User)

📦 Inventory Management

Add new items

Update item quantity and price

Delete items

View all inventory

Search items by name or category

Low stock alerts

💾 Data Persistence

JSON-based file storage

Automatic load/save functionality

CRUD operations for:

Users

Inventory Items

🏗️ Object-Oriented Design

The system uses multiple interacting classes:

User

AdminUser (inherits from User)

Item

InventoryManager

AuthManager

StorageManager

CLI

OOP Concepts Implemented

✅ Classes

✅ Inheritance (AdminUser → User)

✅ Encapsulation (private password handling)

✅ Modular design

✅ Decorators for authentication & permissions
